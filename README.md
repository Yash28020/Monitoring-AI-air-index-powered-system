Monitoring AI Air Index System
📌 Overview

The Monitoring AI Air Index System is an intelligent platform that leverages AI, IoT, and data visualization to monitor and forecast air quality in real time. The system collects data from environmental sensors, processes it using AI models, and generates the Air Quality Index (AQI) with detailed insights.

It empowers citizens, researchers, and policymakers by providing actionable data on air pollution, trends, and forecasts — enabling healthier living decisions and environmental planning.

✨ Features

📡 Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring – Collects pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO₂, O₃).

🤖 AI-Powered Forecasting – Predicts air quality trends using machine learning models.

🚨 Alerts & Notifications – Warns users when air quality reaches hazardous levels.

📊 Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes AQI trends, pollutant levels, and forecasts with charts/maps.

🌐 IoT & Cloud Integration – Works with smart sensors and stores data securely in the cloud.

📱 Cross-Platform Access – Accessible via web browser and mobile devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, TypeScript

Backend (optional extension): Node.js / Express / FastAPI

📈 Air Quality Index (AQI) Standards

The system follows global standards for AQI classification:

AQI Range	Air Quality	Health Impact
0–50	Good	Minimal impact
51–100	Moderate	Acceptable but some pollutants may affect sensitive groups
101–150	Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups	Respiratory issues for vulnerable populations
151–200	Unhealthy	Increased health risks for all
201–300	Very Unhealthy	Health warnings, emergency conditions possible
301+	Hazardous	Serious health effects, warnings issued
📊 Example Dashboard Screens

Real-time AQI chart per city/region.

Forecast graphs for next 24h–7 days.

Heatmap visualization of air pollution across regions.

📌 Future Enhancements

✅ AI model for long-term climate impact analysis.

✅ Mobile app with push notifications.

✅ Integration with smart wearables for personalized health alerts.

✅ Support for satellite and weather APIs.
